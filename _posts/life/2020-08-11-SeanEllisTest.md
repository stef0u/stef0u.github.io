Something I came across that I thought is quite simple and probably overlooked due to it's simplicity; the Sean Ellis Test.

The Sean Ellis test helps determine product market fit by sending out a survey to the customers and asks how would they feel if they could no longer use the product. Their options are 'very disappointed', 'somewhat disappointed', 'don't care' and 'not relevant because I no longer use the product'. If it's more than 40% of the users report back with 'very disappointed' then there's a high chance there's product market fit.

It's simplicity reminds me of the Net Promoter Score where similarily it is also a simple test that surveys the customers and asks if they would recommend the product or company to a friend/family.
