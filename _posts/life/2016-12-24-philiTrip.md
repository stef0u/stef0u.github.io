Drive out of Canada was horrible. It took most 3hours to get out and like 10hrs to get to the destination
We got interrogated at the border for what he's we play, what system, etc. Kun of weird
Drive through the us was kind of uneventful 
The hotel is split in half, white people and black. And they're like the stereotype
Traveling with Jonathan is interesting...
Sir what are you doing
Do we need to be in the car?
