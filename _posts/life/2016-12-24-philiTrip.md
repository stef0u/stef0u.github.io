Gregor found out about a game convention 'Too many Games Con' and we did a long weekend trip to head out there. The drive out of Canada was horrible. it took around 3 hours to get out of the country through Niagara then another 7 hours to get to the destination. We got interrogated at the board for what games we played and for what system. It was kind of weird, but I guess three grown men in a small blue honda fit saying they were going to a game convention did not really seem conventional. The drive through the US was kind of uneventuful. We stayed at a hotel near the convention, and it was a bit weird. The hotel had some club in the back where we went in, and it was split in half in region; white people on one side, and black on the other. And I was the only asian person there. 

The convention was pretty neat where it had games and game consoles going back from the beginning. They even had region-sepcific released consoles that were on sale. It was quite impressive to see the retro gaming community and how big the collector scene really is. I also found out that the Sega Saturn my parents are sitting on and all its games can be resold for quite a bit as there's high demand (at least when I went). All-in-all the convention was neat to see the first time, but not really wanting to drive all the way there again.
