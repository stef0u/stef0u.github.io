| Ingredients | | Quantity |
| -----------: | --- |:-------|
| **Tamarind Puree** |    | 1.5 Tablespoon |
| **Brown Sugar** |    | 3 Tablespoon |
| **Fish Sauce** |    | 2 Tablespoon |
| **Oyster Sauce** |    | 1.5 Tablespoon |

**Notes**
- I consider this to be for 1 serving. However, the recipe was originally for 2; I like my pad thai to be heavier on the sauce. 
- This is just the recipe for the sauce. For the actual dish, it's stirfry so whatever works. Just fry the ingredients first, and if it's ingredients that have a lot of water, cook them first so it does not dilute the padthai sauce.
- Add half the sauce first while cooking with the ingredients to give it more flavour, then after adding the noodles, add in the rest of the sauce to make sure the noodles don't absorbe it all before it gets served.
