## Itinerary Summary
- Sydney: 2 days
- Cairnes: 5 days (3D2N Liveaboard)
- Melbourn: 4 days (Oceans Road, penguins)
- Sydney: 2 days

We got lucky and got cheap tickets to Australia this summer, so that was our summer vacation. We flew from Toronto Sydney with Qantas airline. There was suppose to be a short lay-over at LAX, but it got delayed by 2 hours. The first leg of the flight on on WestJet and that felt long; there was no food, noentertainment other than the ones I hord on my phone. The second leg of the flight was much better as it was wth Qantas. My partner passed out for the entire flight, and I kept going back to eat their food (they had some snack that was like some deep fried empanada that I had to go back to seconds, and thirds :) )

We landed in Sydney and had to go through quarantine. They brought out a cute little doggo that came by to sniff our stuff. There were two controls in front of us to ensure they doggo was doing their job; the dog would sit down if they found anything. They have some strict rules to avoid biological damage to their ecosystem. We took the train from Sydney airport to the central station, then walked to the docks then our rental apartment. Sydney was weird from first impression, people drove on the left, and there were purple trees everywhere.

We got a 50 AUD Opal card for Sydney transportation. It was exactly enough for a round trip to Sydney downtown and a day pass. It's quite conventient, albeit a bit expensive. But speaking of expensive Sydney was definitely that; we had dinner at Harajuku Gyoza (it had a lot of high reviews), but we were quite disappointed. We got gyozas that weren't too entirely specialy, but spend 35$ for the 12 of them; I voted for eating pies (5$) for the rest of the trip -.-


The next day we went to the fish market for a behind the scene tour. We learned about the reverse dutch trade auction. We also learned that to pick a crab/lobster, press down on it. The harder the shell the better the crustacean; specifically press down on the 3rd vetebrae. Also learned about the Black Jew Fish and how it got it's name. the delivery of the story was kind of great; originally the collar bone is darker and you can shine it into a jewel. Learned that clove oil + vodka gives you an anesthetic for underwater creatures. We had instant noodles + fish for dinner. 

We flew to cairns, didn't know they were one hour behind (Australia is really big). We walked along the espanade, the market is quite nice especially behind the market. The food was expensive. There's free BBQ that you can use. Next time go to the supermarket and eat. My partner was a bit sad this day since she forgot her referal book in Sydney, then I made her more sad because I didn't follow through with engravingon the wallet. But I got an idea of how to ingrave it with each city/country we visit. 

We took the liveaboard the next day and started with reef encounter with two boat dives. The boat was quite choppy and my partner got sick. Felt bad for her. She was trying so hard to come out and dive on the reefs. I hope she passes her courses and get better and we can dive leisurely together.

Overall I think the liveaboard was an interesting experience. I got to dive a lot, for the most part I got fed well. But I felt the tour was ran too much like a get-in-get out experience. There wasn't much apart from eat, dive, sleep. I thought they could be more educating with the divers about the great barrier reef and how it's dieing. They got fussy that I got into the hot chocolate stash, like seriously, they even moved it the next day.

On the dives, I saw;
- Eel fighting a GT fish
- Lots of sharks
- Lots of sea turtles
-Some flat worms and nudibranch
- Bigass clams, like the size of my torso. Lots of fishes. I tormented some poor clown fishes
- Lots of dead coral, really sad to see. It was almost like a graveyard
- Dove through a coral dive/swim-through. They are quite hard since a lot of focus on buoyancy. I felt like it was operation where I could touch an edge
- Giant moral eel with fish cleaning mouth
- Lots of lion fishes (5 of them) with lots of little transparent fishes. School fish eating sand
- Got fish eat a small red fish hiding below a coral. Pointed a light on a fish to target it
- Did 3 more dives with my partner; we worked out a system for me to help her out; I was her tug boat =] If we continue diving, hopefully she learns buoyancy but it wasn't the focus now. Wanted to shw her the reefs. Unfortunately we couldn't find a sea turtle. We did see a few sharks, rays, and giant clams.

We returned to cairns, and my partner didn't get very sea sick since we better planned for it this time. We got our car and started to drive on the wrong side of the road again; it was confusing. We got to the Lilly bank B&B and checked in. THe place is okay overall, but there isn't much of a breakfast. It's only a cold one. We met some rich traveling couple from kitchener, ON Canada who seemed quite bittter about the place. We took it in strides.

In any case, the following day we went to Kuranda where the day was pretty much a split between petting zoos and markets.
	- We got to hold a koala, and also saw them while active during the morning
	- we went to the garden before it got crowded so we had pretty much the entire area to oursleves
	- The grey kangaroos followed us for food. It's amusing to see them hop
	- Saw a wombat pace back and forth, it's so chunky and adorable
	- Fed some parrots, stupid macaw ate 3 buttons off my shirt. And a yellow one was taring up my camera bag; such evil creatures
	- The markets were nice, a bunch of crafts and my partner got a pair of white and black pearl studs
We went for a short hike afterwards to explore the area. Went to the Baron's gorge waterfall where we saw some people hanging out on the fall itself. They hitched along the train tracks to get there, something I opted to not do.

Overall Cairns felt like a mix of Hawaii and thailand. The boardwalk is nice with a lagoon, wooden boardwalk, palm trees, very hawaii-esque. The market felt more like thailand with a mix of food stalls, souvenir shops and overall touristy stuff, except everything costed so much. I think on average food at restaurants is 2x North American prices, with smaller portions

We flew down to Moubourne the next day where we got a car and drove mid way down to Ocean's road. We stayed at Melba Gully where we drove through some very thick fog; like you could barely see 3 meters in front of you. With the unfamiliarity of the road and the thick fog it was a pretty stressfull drive. We got to our B&B which was in the middle of nowhere and seemed all very horror film-like. The host was very nice however, and they had two huge dogs that were really nice. They told us about the glow worms and that they are actually just down the road from where we were and worth going there after sunset; we did and it was so dark minus the glow worms. It was a bit trippy. I freaked out a few times because I didn't know people were beside me as I was taking pictures

The B&B was nice and the host was helpful; she gave us tips on where to go along the Ocean road; told us to drive past the 12 apostle first and head to at least Loch Ard Gorge. She was right and there weren't any tourists. We went to the 12 apostles afterwards then drove back to Melbourne. We stayed there for the night and toured the city a bit. The next day we were heading towards the Penguin Parade down south down by Philip Island. The morning we toured the city some more to see what it was light. It's nicer than Sydney in my opinion with more to see. 

We went to Philip island for the Penguin Parade. We got there a bit early to walk the boardwalk. It's quite pretty and it's right on top of the dens. It felt similar to the area I was in Iceland. We even got to see penguins still hanging out under the boardwalk. Also poked a penguin's butt with a stick and see it waddle off.

We got the Penguin Parade Plus ticket so we could get a more secluded view of the Penguins and we were quite lucky that we did; we were right up to the penguins and there was some rainfall the day earlier so there was a small pool of water so as they came back we got to see them swim into the pool then waddle out; there were so many of them it was adorable to see them waddle.
