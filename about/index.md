It seems to be an anual tradition where I try to make a website that sees the light of day for part of a year, then it never gets touched again. I have good intentions, but never got in the habit of updating it regularily to make it a *thing*. And in this case, I actually found the toolset I wanted to use, but I find that the underlying tools have been upgraded, breaking my ability to update the site, so that forced me to redo my site for the 8th time ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

*What is this Site About?*

* **Visual Portfolio:** Art has been always been something I held close to my chest. Throughout the years, the medium has changed; currently digital photography has been the biggest player. From time to time, I freelance for individuals or small companies that do not have the budget to afford professional photographers, but still need some respectable images to bootstrap their future.

* **Work Portfolio:** I formally have a Masters in Biomedical Engineer, but I've managed to find my self working outside that field and in a variety of different positions; Software developer, QA lead, Systems architech, technical product manager for a werable security device. 

* **Personal Portfoio:** Not really a portfolio but didn't want to break the trend. This aspect is about anything and everything about my life, but my life is pretty simple relatively speaking. Other than work, I train for endurance events, and travel whenever I can.
