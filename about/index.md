> "An engineer is someone who does precision guesswork based on unreliable data provided by those of questionable knowledge."

It seems to be an annual tradition where I try to make a website that sees the light of day for part of a year, then it never gets touched again. I have good intentions but never got in the habit of updating it regularly to make it a *thing*. And in this case, I actually found the toolset I wanted to use, but I find that the underlying tools have been upgraded, breaking my ability to update the site, so that forced me to redo my site for the 8th time

*What is this Site About?*

* **Visual Portfolio:** Art has been always been something I held close to my chest. Throughout the years, the medium has changed; currently, digital photography has been the biggest player. From time to time, I freelance for individuals or small companies that do not have the budget to afford professional photographers but needs some images to bootstrap their future.

* **Life Portfolio:** I formally have a Masters in Biomedical Engineer, but I've managed to find my self working outside that field and in a variety of different positions; Software developer, QA lead, Systems architect, technical product manager, field solution architect for a wearable security device. The world has a way of throwing you presenting you new opportunities. Throw in some determination and some creativity and you'll find yourself doing stuff you never expected to; this may not be a bad thing.
