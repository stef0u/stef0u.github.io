| Ingredients | | Quantity |
| -----------: | --- |:-------|
| **Milk** |    | 2 Cups |
| **Egg Yolk** |    | 4 Large |
| **Sugar** |    | 5 Tablespoons |
| **Cornstarch** |    | 6.5 Tablespoons |
| **Vanilla or other flavouring** |    | 1 Teaspoon |


**Instructions**

* Gently heat milk over medium heat 3 to 5 minutes until it just begins to simmer or scalds. 
* In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla until very well incorporated. 
* Slowly whisk small amounts of the scalded milk into the egg yolk mixture to temper. *Tempering means to slowly mix a hot  ingredient into a cold or room-temp ingredient (like the egg yolks) to slowly raise the temperature of the cold or room-temp ingredient whilepreventing it from overcooking (scrambling in the case of the egg yolks).* 
* Once half of the milk is incorporated into the bowl, pour the mixture back into the saucepot and whisk over medium heat  until it becomes thick and creamy. *Do **not** let the pastry cream get any color while cooking.*
* Pour the pastry cream into a plastic-wrap-lined baking pan or wide bowl, lay another sheet of plastic over directly touching the pastry cream, and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes. *Covering the pastry cream will keep it from developing a thick skin on top. *
* Allow the pastry cream to cool completely before use.
