We left Toronto Friday evening on a redeye flight to Venice. The flight was packed and I couldn't sit with my partner. I didn't sleep much on the flight. We got to Venic early, but still managed to check in at 13:00. We stayed at the Leonard Hotel just at Venice Mestre. It's brand new, and I know the franchise from staying in them at the UK; it's a nice boutique hotel. We rested for about 1.5hrs before heading out.

We took the train into Venice, and I forgot how pretty Venice is. We walked along the canals nad made it to the Rialto bridge and wanted to go to San Marco square, but my partner got tired and we never made it there that evening. We had sprits and crostinis for dinner at a local pub - it was quite nice. The sprits was pretty strong.

The next day we went to  Venice early-ish to make it to San Marco square. We took the scenic route, and found a nice cafe to get an espresso and pastry. We also stopped for a cappuchino, and tiramisu but we eventually got there. There was a long line to get into the Cathedral so we opted to not go in. We found another place to get crostinis and they heated it up, which made them much better. The day was also the Venice Regatta festival so the Gran Canal was busier than usual. We got a spot to stand on the southern bridge over the canal, but after 30minutes of waiting they kicked us off. They did not allow anyone to stand. We had to move to a side dock which didn't give as nice of a view. 

We had dinner at a nice restaurant my partner looked up. We didn't make a reservation, but we got a spot luckily. I got squid ink spaghetti and my partner got seafood stew. They were both really good with a lot of flavour. We wandered around at night taking pictures at twilight. Someone stole my picture idea when we went to the southern tip of Venice. I was exhausted by the heat and all the walking. We walked about 22km according to my watch. We really survived the day on sweets. It wasn't too bad. Tomorrow we're off to the Dolomites.

We picked up our car from Avis. They were nice and said we didn't need to bring the car back at the specified returned time. It was a bit confusing at how we had to return the car though. They said we had to go to the 6th floor of a parking garage in some other location with key drop off box in some other location. In any case, we got our Audi Q2 and drove it to the Dolomites. It was rainy that day so it wasn't that adventerous of a day. I got to drive it up the A27, which is a toll route (8eu) but we got to drive as fast as we wanted. 

Got to our hotel (Resident Merk) without a problem but at first they gave us the wrong rom. The helpers couldn't speak english and said too bad in Italian (at least that was the direct translation I understood). We eventually got the manager to come out, and he gave us our right room. We had a pretty big place. It was an apartment for 4 people with kitchen. It was nice to have all the space and spread out. We cooked that night pasta and sausage we picked up in Venice and slept early. The plan for the next day was to catch the sunrise.

In retrospect I screwed up the planning by wanting to get to the trail head at sunrise. Instead should of just aimed for the summit of Passo Gardena. In any case we got to the trail head of Croda Da Lago by sunrise and started the hike. THe beginning of the hike starts in the forest until you get above the treeline. We went left at the fork isntead of right. Going left brought us to the rifugio first by the lake. The view was gorgeous; the lake served as a mirror for the mountain face just beside it. The Rifugio wasn't open when we got there, so we marched on. The trail continued past the lake to a mall pass between the mountains. The view was amazing, Lord of the Ring kind of view. We saw a flock of sheep that was being herded to the nearby pass. We tried to catch them but they climbed faster than we could. At the summit we were both quite pooped.

The hike down was pretty rought; it was more steep and through a rockfield. I got a callus on my pinky toe, and my partner's quads started to get weak and shake. It made going down slower.I ended up taping my toe because I couldn't take it anymore. As we got past the rockfield, I also took the wrong path and ended up getting us lost. We were going down a dried river bed that I thought was the path because I'm an idiot. Luckily I had my GPS watch and did a beeline through the forest back onto the path.

When we got back we found out that driving in the Dolomites is a bit chaotic. There's hairpin turns everywhere, which is normally fine, but there's a constant stream of motorcyclists, cyclists, and buses. With the two lane road and the hairpin turns, it leaves only a few centimeters of clearance. 

At the hotel we crashed pretty hard; I made pasta dinner with some more meat and some weird italitian dough ball. It was incredibly filling and we had too much left over. We went back into the city after dinner to pick up our via ferreta equipment and my partner got her hiking boots. We went to Gran cir that evening to check out the hike we would be doing the next day. My partner was chanting apple strudle since dinner, so we also stopped at the rifugio there to eat one; it wasn't that good apparently.

The nest day we started early again to get to Gran Cir at sunrise. I wanted to summit it for sunrise but it wasn't planned for accordingly unfortunately. The hike to the train was pretty rough; not sure if it was the altitude or the previous hike at Croda Da Lago, or a combination of Bother. However, it was hard to get to the trail. We finally got to the rock field and made out way to the top. There are two cable sections that is not overlly exposed. Many people do the hike without any equipment. For some sections I didn't bother with it either. We got to the top and the views were amazing. You had a full 360 degree view of the area.

The hike down was tireing especially for my partner. He legs didn't recover really from the previous day and her legs were shaking lots. We made it down though without trouble. Originally we considered the piccolo cir, but decided against it when we hiked past it. We lounged around in the city for a bit before returning the equipment because for some reason italy stores stop working from 1200-1500. We wandered through the town and got some more food. My partner found out that there was a lot of variety of chocolates and liquore italy has to offer.

We checked into Hotel San Giovanni Hotel in another village further south from Val Gardena. It wasn't what I expected since it had no AC nor did it have a door fo the washroom. Yes, you had clear line of sight to the shower. THe hosts didn't speak any english. We drove around to catch the sunset. The rocks turn pink/orange at sunset that makes them look on fire. We didn't really find a good spot to take a picture, but we did see it and it was pretty. We had dinner at a nearby bar after looking around. My partner got spinach spetzle that was good and I got a big pizza

The next day we slept in until 7am to try and go for the Secceda Gondola at 8:30. We had breakfast at the hotel, and had to drive back to Ortisei. My planning was kind of dumb because there was a lot of driving back and forth. In the end, it was a good idea that we got the car.

Secceda was beaitufl, we hiked along the ridgeline then into the bowl to the other side where there's a small refugio. We got to see donkeys, cows, highland cows, sheeps and horses. Saw one guy kissing a donkey and a baby being scared of the hose. She kept saying 'no no no no' and pulls down her hood while her Dad was petting the hose. THe day was beautiful, with some clouds in the sky. We hiked the majority of the day then drove to Castlerotto and Siusei. THere was a picture that my partner showed me and said she the mountain and the rolling green hills. Who am I to not deliver?

We drove back to Passo Sella to see sunet but the clouds blocked any kind of sunset. So we drove back to Ortesei for dinner. We drove a lot that day. We got to a bar where ball got a huge steak; it was litterally the biggest I have ever seen in Europe, can be considered American size. We droback to the hotel.

I woke up at 5:30 again trying for sunrise again, but it was raining that day. We drove around to see if there was anything at all we could see, but to no avail. We stayed in instead then found a local festival. It turned out to be more of a German beer tent similar to Oktoberfest; I tried describing it to other people before, but it's really something you need to experience. My partner got sweinhaxe and I got 1/2 a chicken. Their service was incredibly fast. Like within 30s of ordering it was at your table. We also tried grappa and some local desserts. The night was fun with live music.

The next day we drove back to Venice. We tried to take a scenic route again, but it was cloudy and partially rainy so we couldn't see again. In retrospect it was nice that we had some nice weather those days. The subsequent days were forecasted to be all raining. We drove through Passo Rolle, then through the Dolomite National Park. The National Park had a nice lake where we stopped and had lunch. 

We returned to Venice without a hitch, but driving back in the city was confusing with the different road layouts. We missed the exit a few times, and drove around in circles trying to find a gas station. We parked our car in the car park and saw another couple also confused with the rental car return. We checked into our last hotel Stay City apartments, which was just across our first hotel. It turns out it was brand new (opened in August). We went out into Venice for one last time.

We went out to do some shopping and my partner picked up some souvenirs. We made it to the Rialto bridge for sunset, and it was crowded. I had my tripod on my back, which made is hard to maneuver; I accidentally hit my partner's head when turning around :( We went to another local spot that my partner found for dinner. The first time we got there, it looked like it was shut down, but it was open when we got there. I thought the pasta was quite nice, but my partner was kind of disappointed because she wanted spaghetti, which she compromised for a penne because it came with shimp. But the shimps were small and was not what she expected. We tried making it up by getting Pizza, but the first pizza place we found was also a disappointment because they burnt the slice. So we went to another one, but that was overly salty. Ah well, it happens when exploring for new food.

This was the end of the trip. Good bye.
