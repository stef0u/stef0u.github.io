#Overview / Features:
The [Aftershokz Xtrainerz](https://aftershokz.ca/products/xtrainerz?utm_medium=StefouWasHere) is a unique set of headphones that uses bone conduction to play music. The sound comes from two pads that are placed just in front of the ear cancel, which allows you to hear the music as well as the surrounding.

The headphones have 4gb of memory onboard that removes its dependency on any other device. They are extremely light at only 30g, and the design is one-size-fits-all that wraps around the head. It is coated in a subtle rubber durometer that gives it a nice texture.

There are four buttons on the right sides;
- long front button that controls increasing the sound, and moving forward in the playlist
- middle button to control play / stop and  on / off
- long back button that controls decreasing the sound, and moving back in the playlist
- back button that controls playback mode (e.g. shuffle) and swim-mode

The headphones are IP68 rated, thus they are waterproof to 50m and dustproof. There is also no microphone or Bluetooth.

#Review after 2 months of usage
##Pros:
- They have onboard memory. Onboard memory seems to be outdated now due to streaming services everywhere. However, there is simply that comes with onboard memory that lets you reduce dependencies on other devices while also extending its battery life.
- They are waterproof up to 50m. With the onboard memory, it makes it especially useful for me when doing lap swimming and I want to listen to something other than the constant drone of water slapping and air bubbles.
- You can listen to the surrounding without having to use only one headphone. I like to have some music playing in the background when commuting, biking, or working out. But I've been hesitant on certain occasions since I prioritize awareness of my surrounding to ensure I do not get hit by a passing car, cyclist, or pedestrian.
- Uploading music is straight forward. Plug the device into the USB-adapter and external storage will appear. Simply drag and drop .mp3 files into the folder and you're good to go

##Things I noticed:
These are not necessarily cons, but more like things that I noticed that ran through my mind as I was using it. These are not deal breakers and would not cause me to hesitate in buying a replacement pair
- I would remove the additional welcome branding message; every time you turn it on it says 'Welcome to Aftershokz'. I imagine it's thrown in there to kill time while the firmware is booting up or something similar. I would have gone straight into the battery level or more informative battery level such as '8hrs of playtime remaining'.
- There is no visual indicator of the device state. Some times, it's not obvious if the Aftershokz is off or on and not playing.
- When turning up the sound intensity to the max, the earpads start to have noticeable vibrations that give the ear a weird sensation.
- They are a bit expensive. They retail at $209 CAD. They did have a spring sale that went on just after I purchased my headset where they had a 30% price drop.
- They require a proprietary adaptor to charge and upload music; I don't like the idea of proprietary adaptors in general because the entire device then becomes dependent on its existence. 
- They could combine the [Aftershokz Xtrainerz](https://aftershokz.ca/products/xtrainerz?utm_medium=StefouWasHere) with the [Aftershokz Aeroplex](https://aftershokz.ca/products/aeropex?utm_medium=StefouWasHere) model to have both onboard and streaming music. I think with a lot of music being online services, being able to transfer/sync music from the cellphone would be a great asset. It would also give the device a graphical interface for users to manage their music, create playlists etc. 
- Adding a microphone to the suite will give a neat feature where you can throw out the standard model of increasing sound. Instead, you will be able to create an algorithm to control the music-to-ambient sound ratio to ensure the user will always have an audible level regardless of the surrounding.
- I would give it the ability to upgrade firmware offline. Granted this can be argued it's unneeded development to have a bootloader, but it would give the device more flexibility for futureproofing if bugs were discovered after launch (e.g. battery life enhancements)

Conclusion:
In my opinion, the [Aftershokz Xtrainerz](https://aftershokz.ca/products/xtrainerz?utm_medium=StefouWasHere) serves a very specific niche segment of people who essentially want some background music to their daily activities. Having it used it for a few months now, they seem like an excellent pair of headphones. They are a bit soft at times with a lot of external sounds, but that's unavoidable given the nature of things. If it wasn't for the hefty price (or if they run their sale again), I would consider getting a second pair if these go out.
