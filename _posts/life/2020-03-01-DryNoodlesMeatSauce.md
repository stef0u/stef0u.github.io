**Notes**
- I treat this pretty much as stirfry when making it, so I throw in any ingredients that I have in the pot.
- Make the sauce mixture in advance and dehydrate the shiitake mushrooms, before frying the meat.
- In a big frying pan, heat up the oil, and cook the shallots and green onion to be translucent
- Fry the ground meat
- While frying, add the 5-spice a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to season the meat while cooking
- Add in the remaining sauce mixture when the meat is cook
- Some starch can be added to thicken the sauce (~2 teaspoon)
