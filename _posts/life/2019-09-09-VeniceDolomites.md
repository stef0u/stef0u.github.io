We left Toronto Friday evening on a redeye flight to Venice, Italy. The trip was planned to land in Venice, then drive up to the Dolomites region, Val Gardena, for 5 days, then back to Venice. 

The flight to Venice was full, and I couldn't sit with Zoe. The flight was pretty cold, and I couldn't get much sleep on the flight. We managed to land an hour earlier than planned and got to check into our hotel right at 13:00. We stayed in a nice boutique hotel, Leonard Hotel in Venice Mestre; it's brand new, and I'm familiar with the franchaise in the UK. It's right by the train station to Venice proper, and was significantly cheaper than anything there.

We took the train into Venice St. Lucia station (1.30EU) after settling in. I have been to Venice a few times now, once during Carnival, but it was a first for Zoe. Venice is really pretty as a city. There's canals and bridges everywhere and surrounded by colourful buildings. We walked along the canals, visiting shops, and geltaerias. Our plan for the day was to make it to San Marco square, but with the redeye flight Zoe got tired and only made it slightly past the Rialto bridge. We went to a local watering hole for some strong Aperol Sprits and crostinis. 

We woke up relatively early the following day to go to Venice so that we could make it to San Marco square. We took the scenic route to get there and stopped at nice cafes for an espresso and pastries. We found a really local one where they had a really good spread of pastries that were all just 1.40EU. We snacked all morning; we found a place that sold nice tiramisu and another place to get corstinis (this place heated them up, which made them much better). We eventually made out way to San Marco square, but we didn't stay long. We wanted to go into the cathedral but the line was long and opted to not stand in the heat to get in. 

The day was particularly busy because the day was the annual Rialto Regatta festival. We found a spot on the southern bridge over the Grand canal, but after waiting 30 minutes in the sun, the police came by and kicked us off. I was annoyed that they let us stand there for 30 minutes before saying anything (they were there the entire time we were there and told people to not sit on the bridge). We had to move to a small dock between buildings, which didn't give as nice of a view. The Regatta was nice to see with a lot of gondolas dressed up in traditional garmets, and lots of boats going down the canal.

We left the Gran Canal shortly after it started and went for dinner at a nice restaurant Zoe found. We didn't make reservation, but they said we could sit down if we left in an hour. For dinner I got squid ink spaghetti, and Zoe got seafood stew. They were both really good with a lot of flavour. We also tried to get a stuffed-squid, but unfortunately they ran out. 

We wandered around town at night taking pictures after dinner. We went to the southern tip of Venice by Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute. I was pretty exhausted by the end of that day; the combination of heat, walking (22 km according to my watch) and snacking on sweets all morning started to take a toll. We went back to the hotel shortly after and started to prepare for traveling to the Dolomites.

During the planning phase of our trip, we found out that if we rented from Avis.com vs Avis.ca we could get a cheaper price; odd but it is what it is. We picked up our car that day and said that we didn't need to bring the car back at the specified return time since we already paid for a full day. Their return instructions were a bit confusing since we had to return it on the 6th floor of a parking lot down the street, then drop off the keys in some other location. They gave us an Audi Q2, which is probably the biggest car I've ever rented. We only got that car because it was one of the few automatic cars they had. We picked up some groceries before we headed out at the local supermarket, then set off for the Dolomites.

it was rainy that day so it wasn't much of an adventerous day. We drove up the A27, which is a toll route (8 eu) but we got to drive as fast as we wanted; i hit 180 km/hr :) We got to our hotel at Resident Merk a bit early. The helpers showed us the wrong room originally, and we had to get them get the manager out who gave us the proper room. We got a 4 person room with a kitchen, which probably caused the original confusion. We called it in pretty early that night since the next day we planned to catch the sunrise.

In retrospect, I screwed up a lot of the planning in the Dolomites. We ended up driving a lot more than we should have because we found the hikes we wanted to do after we found places to stay. And despite the trail head distances from the hotels weren't too far (\~20km away), it did not reflect how long it took to drive the trailheads.

We woke up at 4:30am to do our hike at Croda Da Lago hoping to get there by sunrise and do the hike. In retrospect we should of got up later, and got pictures at the summet of Passo Gardena. The beginning of the hike starts in the forest with a steady climb up until you are roughly above the treeline. We ended up doing the hike clockwise, which brought us to the rifugio by the lake first. The rifugio wasn't open when we got there, so we marched on passed the lake and into a small pass between the mountains. The view was goregous; it was like a set for Lord of the Ring. As we climbed further up, we saw a flock of sheep that was being herded up the pass and into the nearby pasture. We tried to catch up to them but they climbed faster than we could hike. When we got to the top of the pass, we were both quite pooped.

I think the hard part of the hike was the way down; it was more steep and through a rockfield. I got a blister on my pinky toe that started to bleed, and Zoe's quads started to get shaky; it made going down slower. I ended up taping my toe because I couldn't take the pain anymore. As we got past the rockfield, I also took the wrong path and ended up getting us lost. We ended up going down a dried river bed that seemed like the path because I'm an idiot. Luckily, my GPS watch saved us and navigated us back onto the path.


------------------------------

When we got back we found out that driving in the Dolomites is a bit chaotic. There's hairpin turns everywhere, which is normally fine, but there's a constant stream of motorcyclists, cyclists, and buses. With the two lane road and the hairpin turns, it leaves only a few centimeters of clearance. 

At the hotel we crashed pretty hard; I made pasta dinner with some more meat and some weird italitian dough ball. It was incredibly filling and we had too much left over. We went back into the city after dinner to pick up our via ferreta equipment and Zoe got her hiking boots. We went to Gran cir that evening to check out the hike we would be doing the next day. Zoe was chanting apple strudle since dinner, so we also stopped at the rifugio there to eat one; it wasn't that good apparently.

The nest day we started early again to get to Gran Cir at sunrise. I wanted to summit it for sunrise but it wasn't planned for accordingly unfortunately. The hike to the trail was pretty rough; not sure if it was the altitude or the previous hike at Croda Da Lago, or a combination of Both. However, it was hard to get to the trail. We finally got to the rock field and made out way to the top. There are two cable sections that is not overlly exposed. Many people do the hike without any equipment. For some sections I didn't bother with it either. We got to the top and the views were amazing. You had a full 360 degree view of the area.

The hike down was tiring especially for Zoe. He legs didn't recover really from the previous day and her legs were shaking lots. We made it down though without trouble. Originally we considered the piccolo cir, but decided against it when we hiked past it. We lounged around in the city for a bit before returning the equipment because for some reason italy stores stop working from 1200-1500. We wandered through the town and got some more food. Zoe found out that there was a lot of variety of chocolates and liquore italy has to offer.

We checked into Hotel San Giovanni Hotel in another village further south from Val Gardena. It wasn't what I expected since it had no AC nor did it have a door fo the washroom. Yes, you had clear line of sight to the shower. The hosts didn't speak any english. We drove around to catch the sunset. The rocks turn pink/orange at sunset that makes them look on fire. We didn't really find a good spot to take a picture, but we did see it and it was pretty. We had dinner at a nearby bar after looking around. Zoe got spinach spetzle that was good and I got a big pizza

The next day we slept in until 7am to try and go for the Secceda Gondola at 8:30. We had breakfast at the hotel, and had to drive back to Ortisei. My planning was kind of dumb because there was a lot of driving back and forth. In the end, it was a good idea that we got the car.

Secceda was beautiful, we hiked along the ridgeline then into the bowl to the other side where there's a small refugio. We got to see donkeys, cows, highland cows, sheeps and horses. Saw one guy kissing a donkey and a baby being scared of the hose. She kept saying 'no no no no' and pulls down her hood while her Dad was petting the hose. The day was beautiful, with some clouds in the sky. We hiked the majority of the day then drove to Castlerotto and Siusei. There was a picture that Zoe showed me and said she wanted to see towering mountains with rolling green hills. Who am I to not deliver?

We drove back to Passo Sella to see sunet but the clouds blocked any kind of sunset. So we drove back to Ortesei for dinner. We drove a lot that day. We got to a bar where ball got a huge steak; it was litterally the biggest I have ever seen in Europe, can be considered American size. We droback to the hotel.

I woke up at 5:30 again trying for sunrise again, but it was raining that day. We drove around to see if there was anything at all we could see, but to no avail. We stayed in instead then found a local festival. It turned out to be more of a German beer tent similar to Oktoberfest; I tried describing it to other people before, but it's really something you need to experience. Zoe got sweinhaxe and I got 1/2 a chicken. Their service was incredibly fast. Like within 30s of ordering it was at your table. We also tried grappa and some local desserts. The night was fun with live music.

The next day we drove back to Venice. We tried to take a scenic route again, but it was cloudy and partially rainy so we couldn't see again. In retrospect it was nice that we had some nice weather those days. The subsequent days were forecasted to be all raining. We drove through Passo Rolle, then through the Dolomite National Park. The National Park had a nice lake where we stopped and had lunch. 

We returned to Venice without a hitch, but driving back in the city was confusing with the different road layouts. We missed the exit a few times, and drove around in circles trying to find a gas station. We parked our car in the car park and saw another couple also confused with the rental car return. We checked into our last hotel Stay City apartments, which was just across our first hotel. It turns out it was brand new (opened in August). We went out into Venice for one last time.

We went out to do some shopping and Zoe picked up some souvenirs. We made it to the Rialto bridge for sunset, and it was crowded. I had my tripod on my back, which made is hard to maneuver; I accidentally hit Zoe's head when turning around :( We went to another local spot that Zoe found for dinner. The first time we got there, it looked like it was shut down, but it was open when we got there. I thought the pasta was quite nice, but Zoe was kind of disappointed because she wanted spaghetti, which she compromised for a penne because it came with shimp. But the shimps were small and was not what she expected. We tried making it up by getting Pizza, but the first pizza place we found was also a disappointment because they burnt the slice. So we went to another one, but that was overly salty. Ah well, it happens when exploring for new food.

The trip went by fast but we both want to come back again. We heard the dolomites are good to visit year round. A winter trip might be nice? :) Italy has a lot of culture and hisotry as well as good food to offer. And the mountains were accessible and breathtakingly beautiful. We said our goodbyes to Italy and hopped on the plane home the next day. It was a good trip.
