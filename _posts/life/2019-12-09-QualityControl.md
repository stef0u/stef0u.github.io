I came across this definition and wanted to share it; it's about Quality in the field of software product development. Having moved between Software development, QA lead, and product I've found that depending on which hat you are wearing, you tend to have an isolated view on quality. However, quality as a whole is much larger than any one of the departments; a bug or defect is not reflective of any one department.

> Quality is a customer determination, not an engineer's determination, not a marketing determination, nor a general management determination. It is based on the customer's actual experience with the product or service, measured against his or her requirements -- stated or unstated, conscious or merely sensed, technically operational or entirely subjective -- and always representing a moving target in a competitive market.[17]

This is from the ISO 9126-1, which has been recently updated to the ISO/IEC 25010:2011. The updated standard breaks quality model in 8 different characteristics with sub characteristics listed below. It is a pretty exhaustive list and it is not always possible to ensure quality in all characteristics. However, it is important to be aware that all of these characteristics help determine the quality of the end product.
