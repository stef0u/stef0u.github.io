As a precursor, I enjoy restaurants that are simple, no frills and just focuses on food. Toronto does not have a street food culture like parts of asia, but it does have lots of good food and should get some recognition if it doesn't already.

- [Tinuno](http://tinunothirtyone.com/?utm_medium=StefouWasHere)
Traditional Filipino food. Kamayan; eating with hands. It has very fragrant garlic rice with a lot of grilled fish/pork and veggies. The last times I went, they gave ample supply of garlic rice with top up when you're running low, and the option of getting pork belly (that's off menu)

Good japanese style ramen. The one in College and Bathurst seems to be better than the one on King despite them being the same name.

A really nice mom-pop korean shop located near Cristie PIts. It's really a no frills restaurant that does table BBQ. They give you nice portions so you walk out quite full. The owner (mom) really knows how to bustle and will take care you of you.

Another Korean bbq joint that's also located in near Cristie Pits. I think it's a franchaise since I saw another one uptown near markham. They're also another traditional korean bbq (not AYCE) and have a good mix of side dishes. They kept giving cheesy corn. 

- [One2Snacks](https://www.google.com/search?q=one%20two%20snack&oq=onetwosnack&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l4.2708j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&sxsrf=ACYBGNRn6_c6h_ZrsYnn6mBAmUFma0HX4g:1577120738204&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=43781407,-79344948,5521&tbm=lcl&rldimm=13914961190805711257&lqi=Cg1vbmUgdHdvIHNuYWNrWhcKABgAGAEYAiINb25lIHR3byBzbmFjaw&phdesc=SpdCcLqAGV8&ved=2ahUKEwiShfnKoMzmAhUKPK0KHSsxBPAQvS4wAXoECAsQLg&rldoc=1&tbs=lrf:!1m4!1u3!2m2!3m1!1e1!1m4!1u2!2m2!2m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e2!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!2m1!1e16!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:9&rlst=f#rlfi=hd:;si:13914961190805711257,l,Cg1vbmUgdHdvIHNuYWNrWhcKABgAGAEYAiINb25lIHR3byBzbmFjaw,y,SpdCcLqAGV8;mv:[[43.7879019,-79.268393],[43.7749123,-79.4215043]];tbs:lrf:!1m4!1u3!2m2!3m1!1e1!1m4!1u2!2m2!2m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e2!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!2m1!1e16!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:9)
A true hole in the wall place. The store front is minimal with barely any seating place. But their food is amazing. They specialized in maylasian style food. Their laksa has so much flavour and seems to be as authentic as you can get it (haven't been to Malaysia). Only problem is that they tend to run out of food within the first few hours of opening; they tend to have long lines before even opening. So your only chance of tasting their lovely food is by reserving a day before.

- [Gourmet Malaysia](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Gourmet+Malaysia+Restaurant/@43.7888417,-79.2698519,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89d4d10d2463cfbd:0x88bf93a17450d5c7!8m2!3d43.7883888!4d-79.266684)
When entering the restaurant it looks like a karaoke hall, but if you can get past its appearance food is quite good. Their Rotis are on point with the right amount of flake and chew. 

- [Makkal Chon](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Makkal+Chon/@43.7501557,-79.2977159,12z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1skorean!3m4!1s0x0:0xe323dc6c3af6524f!8m2!3d43.7446074!4d-79.2962694)
Another Korean restaurant that's on the East end in Scarborough. I enjoy their shared hot pot. They have a nice selection of side dishes. However, there's been recent hit-and-miss with the restaurant with some of their staff. There were a few group of friends who went there and they said the service was horrible (luckily I've never experienced that).

- [Crown Prince Fine Dinging and Banquet](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Crown+Prince+Fine+Dining+and+Banquet/@43.8096495,-79.3410966,16z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1skorean!3m4!1s0x0:0xe4161d8fbdff5f70!8m2!3d43.8063892!4d-79.3386108)
One of the many dim sum places in Scarborough. They have a pretty grand interior. For the most part their dim sum is good, with only the bbq puff pastry and beef ribs standing out for me.

- [Elegance Chinese Cusine & Banquet](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/%E9%9B%85%E6%99%AF%E8%B1%AA%E8%8B%91+Elegance+Chinese+Cuisine+%26+Banquet/@43.8233094,-79.3285814,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1skorean!3m4!1s0x0:0xf09a4b9f639296be!8m2!3d43.8245192!4d-79.3262786)
Another dim sum place in Scarborough just behind the T&T at Warden and steeles. It's a simple no frills dim sum.
