This post is a sample of what I would be doing with the most of my time. I've come to realize that with all the tools out there, wordpress, flickr, blog, google sites, there's just something that's not right with all of them; they did not separate sylization from content. Jekyll seems to provide this separation, which allows content to be made independently from the design. Sure it may not create the more animated sites you get with more complex tools, but it's simple, and who doesn't like simplicity.

Another benefit is that github pages hosts sites for free. So with the combination of flickr for mediat storage (free 1tb) and github pages for hosting makes a real cheap website solution. The only thing that would make this complete would be a domain, which you must pay for unfortunately.

So here's a bunch of pictures and how it looks like.
